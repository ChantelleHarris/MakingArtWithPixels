This is a Udacity assignment that requires using JavaScript to allow a user to create a grid of any size
and populate each cell with chosen colors to make beautiful art. With this  project, I will practice
creating, removing, and grabbing elements in the DOM. I will also practing adding event listeners.  

Every student was given the same template to begin with that had basic styling. Once my app was fully 
functional, I re-made the design to my liking. Do enjoy!

For this project, I rely heavily on the notes I've taken from the course material.
